# AVL-tree-
Implemented a self-balancing binary search tree (AVL tree) in C++ for efficient data storage and retrieval. Utilized concepts such as tree rotations, height balancing, and recursive algorithms to maintain a balanced tree structure, ensuring fast insertion, deletion, and retrieval of data.
